This model analyzes customer data to predict churn using a neural network. It preprocesses data, handles missing values, and converts categorical features. A Keras Sequential model, optimized with 'adam' and 'binary_crossentropy', learns complex patterns. Dropout layers and EarlyStopping callbacks prevent overfitting, ensuring the model generalizes well to new data. This optimization helps the model make accurate, data-driven predictions, mimicking a human's ability to identify churn risks but with computational efficiency and scale. Evaluation metrics like accuracy and a classification report assess its performance.
