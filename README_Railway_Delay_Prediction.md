This project predicts railway delays using a Random Forest model trained on historical railway data. It supports single and multi-station delay forecasting with user input. The pipeline includes preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment via Joblib. Ideal for transport analytics and real-time delay estimation applications.
