This project predicts railway delays using a Random Forest regression model trained on historical data. It preprocesses categorical and numerical features with a pipeline and supports both single and multi-station delay predictions. The model is serialized with Joblib for reuse. User input functions allow interactive predictions via terminal. Ideal for transport analytics and delay forecasting. Built with scikit-learn, pandas, and NumPy. Accuracy evaluated using MAE and RÂ² metrics.
